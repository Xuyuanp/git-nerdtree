The NERD Tree
=============

New Feature
----------

Add git status support for NERDTree.You can indicate a file's git status, quickly see which files you have staged, unstaged and modified, or deleted in your project without any extra work.

Add `let g:nerdtree_show_git_status = 1` to your vimrc.

NOTE
----

Now it's is still under development, there may be a lot of bug. Welcome your pull request!

**Trouble:** As I'm not very familiar with the results of `git status -s` command, so the indicator may be wrong. 

TODO
----

* add key mapping, default: `]c` to next change, `[c` to prev chang.

* refresh git status realtime.

**Happy Coding!!!!**
